    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively dense (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively sparse (represented as a bag-of-words). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "ANSWER:\n",
    "1) Why doesn't k-Nearest Neighbors work well for this problem?\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN uses similarity or distance metrics. There are many common words between all documents; the most common words in a document are likely the most common words in all of the other documents. Because of that, it is more difficult for the assigned similarity metric to correctly classify the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Why doesn't Logistic Regression work as well as Naive Bayes does?\n",
    "\n",
    "For logistic regression, overfitting may occur when the number of samples is less than the number of features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) What is the relationship between logistic regression's sum of squared weights vs. C value?\n",
    "\n",
    "The  C value is the inverse of regularization strength. Greater C values have a smaller regularization strength, which means smaller sum of squared weights. This is consistent with the printed C values and sum of squared weights."

    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features.\n",

Evaluate and show the L1 regularization strength, vocabulary size, and f1 score associated with the new model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Unlike `CountVectorizer`, `TfidfVectorizer` considers the problem that the most common words in a document are likely the most common words in all of the other documents. `TfidfVectorizer` the tfidf metric to give less weight to words frequently used in other documents. `CountVectorizer` uses just word fequency.\n",

    "- The tfidf metric is not a good measurement for short documents.\n",
    "- Religion documents and atheism documents share common terms; we caught a glimpse of in part 4. This makes classifying these documents more difficult.\n",

    "3) Explain what the R ratio describes.\n",

    "For each sample, there is a predicted probability of the sample assigned to each label. The predicted label is the label with the highest predicted probability. The R ratio is that highest predicted probability divided by the predict probability of the correct label.\n",
